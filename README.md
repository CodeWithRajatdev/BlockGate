# ðŸš€ BlockSubmit  

**BlockSubmit** is a simple and beginner-friendly Solidity smart contract that records and tracks on-chain job submissions for transparent review.  
Itâ€™s designed to help developers understand how blockchain can be used to verify, store, and manage digital entries securely.

---

## ðŸ§  Project Description
BlockSubmit provides a decentralized way to store and retrieve job or task submissions on the blockchain.  
Each submission is timestamped, publicly viewable, and permanently recorded â€” ensuring transparency and trust in how job entries are managed.

---

## ðŸ’¼ What It Does
- Allows users to **submit job entries** (title and description).  
- Stores each submission **on-chain** with a unique ID and timestamp.  
- Anyone can **view existing submissions**.  
- Makes data **tamper-proof and transparent**, unlike traditional centralized databases.
